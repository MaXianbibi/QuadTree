# ðŸŒ³ 2D Quadtree Visualization (C++)

A 2D Quadtree data structure implemented in C++ with a real-time visual representation. This project demonstrates efficient spatial partitioning, useful for collision detection, game development, and graphical applications.

## Key Features

- Dynamic insertion and subdivision of spatial data points  
- Real-time 2D visualization of quadtree nodes and partitions  
- Interactive interface to explore quadtree structure  
- Optimized C++ implementation for performance
